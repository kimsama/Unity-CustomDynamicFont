# Unity-CustomDynamicFont

A simple bare-bone sample which demonstrates the usage of Unity3D's dynamic font renderer for ones own dynamic font rendering system. It is written due to the lack of sample code on [Unity3D's official document](http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/) about the dynamic font renderer and its related APIs.

No font coloring, no alignment, no wordwrap but the project shows only minimum code to render a text with Unity3D's dynamic font renderer. Though you should wrote that for your own custom dynamic font renderer system but this project is good staring point. It is highly recommeded to see NGUI's [UILabel](http://www.tasharen.com/ngui/docs/class_u_i_label.html), [UIWidget](http://www.tasharen.com/ngui/docs/class_u_i_widget.html) and [UIDrawCall](http://www.tasharen.com/ngui/docs/class_u_i_draw_call.html) if you want to write practical custom dynamic font renderer.
